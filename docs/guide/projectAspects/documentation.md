# Documentation

Documentation is a critical part of any successful data project. It improves **collaboration**, ensures **knowledge sharing**, and enables **future maintainability** for the architecture, codebase, and operations.

To address this, a dedicated documentation site was created for the IMDb Serverless ETL project.

## Framework
The documentation was built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a lightweight, fast, and modern static site generator powered by Vite and Vue.

It provides:

- Built-in support for Markdown.
- Automatic sidebar and navigation.
- Fast development experience.
- Easy deployment.

> VitePress was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and seamless developer experience.
