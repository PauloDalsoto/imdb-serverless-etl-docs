Hey there â€” Iâ€™m Paulo Dalsoto, a curious and challenge-driven software engineer from Brazil. I love building things that solve real problems, whether itâ€™s a data pipeline, a backend service, or an automated workflow in the cloud. My approach is hands-on, iterative, and focused on learning by doing.

What moves me is growth â€” not just personal, but in how technology can scale, optimize, and connect ideas across domains.

## ðŸ§­ Career Path & Evolution

### ðŸ”Œ Getting Started â€“ Hardware Meets Logic  
My story began in a technical high school focused on electronics. While most of my peers stuck with circuits, I found myself increasingly fascinated by the logic behind systems â€” and how software could control and extend the physical world. That mix of **low-level understanding and abstract problem-solving** shaped how I think today.

### âœ… Quality, First  
My first role in tech was as a QA tester in a team working on **Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)**. I was embedded in an Agile team, working closely with developers. Thatâ€™s where I truly understood the full software development lifecycle â€” and the **strategic role of testing** in building reliable, scalable software.

### ðŸ“ˆ From Data to Decisions  
I then transitioned into a hybrid **data science and backend development** position. One of the most impactful projects I contributed to was for **BOSCH**, where we used historical warehouse data to build a model that predicts production order durations. That solution is now running in major distribution hubs across Brazil.

This experience deepened my skills in **ETL pipelines, cloud workflows, machine learning, and backend automation** â€” while reinforcing my passion for scalable, data-driven engineering.

### ðŸ§© Enterprise Engineering at SAP  
Today, I work at **SAP** as a Development Consultant. My day-to-day ranges from implementing SAP Notes and customizing backend logic to large-scale **system upgrades and cloud integration projects**.

Although much of my current stack is **ABAP, SQL, and SAP BTP**, I approach problems with a cross-stack mindset. For example, what I build in Python, I can usually replicate in ABAP, itâ€™s just a matter of syntax and tooling. I believe that regardless of the language or framework, the core principles of software development remain the same.

Recently, I became a **certified ABAP Cloud Developer** by SAP, and that only fueled my drive to keep bridging the gap between enterprise systems and modern cloud practices.


## ðŸš€ Looking Ahead

Iâ€™m actively pursuing opportunities to work at the intersection of **backend, data engineering, and cloud-native architecture**.

My long-term goal is to become a **technical leader** capable of delivering end-to-end solutions that combine the robustness of enterprise systems with the agility of cloud-native design.  
I want to work on things that matter â€” tools that empower teams, pipelines that unlock insight, and services that scale intelligently.

Whether it's refining an ETL job, tuning a Lambda function, or rethinking a legacy flow, I approach every project with curiosity, ownership, and a genuine desire to deliver impact.
